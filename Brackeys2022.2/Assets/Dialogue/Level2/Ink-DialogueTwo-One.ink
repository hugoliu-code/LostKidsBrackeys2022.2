Hi again...
Sorry if I came off as rude last time we met...
I haven't spoken to anybody in a long time.
...
I'm a nice person usually, I promise.
I'll help you get out of here.
There's a strange creature in these walls. 
I call him stan.
I've never actually seen him because of how dark it is,
But he sounds big and scary.
He screams whenever he sees me I think.
Hopefully he is nice to you!
Good luck friend!
